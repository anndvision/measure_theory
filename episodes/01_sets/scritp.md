Measure theory Part 1. 

Sets. 

A set is a mathematical model for a collection of things. 

It could be a collection of elephants, 
a collection of numbers, 
or even a deck of cards. 

Members of a set, like the ace of spades, are called elements.

An element of the set of furniture found in a living room, could even be a television set

Sets are written as a comma separated list of elements 

enclosed between two curly brackets. 

And are typically denoted by capital letters in a serif or script font.
