2.5@60      Measure Theory Part 2:

            Functions

3.0@72      A function establishes a relationship between two sets.

3.0@72      For example, consider a set of glassware and a set of stationary.

5.0@120     A function from the glassware to the stationery assigns a unique element of stationery to each glass in the glassware set.

2.5@60      The set of glassware is called the function's domain, 

2.5@60      and the set of stationery is called its co-domain.

2.5@60      The function's range is the set of satationery that are actually assigned to glassware.

4.5@108     The image of a function represents the the function's value evaluated at an element within the domain.

5.0@120     Here, a stapler would be the image of the function from glassware to stationery, evaluated at a specific vase.
