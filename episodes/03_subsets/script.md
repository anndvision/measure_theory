2.5@60      Measure Theory Part 3:

            Subsets

4@96        A subset is a concept that builds upon the idea of sets.

5@120       For illustration, Imagine a set of living room furniture: a 
		    coffee table, a lamp, a sofaâ€¦

3@72        Now, consider just the sofa and the coffee table.

4@96        This smaller set is a subset of the original set of 
            furniture.

5.5@132     In general, a set A is a subset of B if every element 
            in A is also an element in B.

6@144       Every set is a subset of itself, which            
            will lead into the intriguing subject of Part 4: the empty set.
